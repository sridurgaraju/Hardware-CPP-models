# Hardware-CPP-models

This repository contains **C++ implementations of hardware-inspired functional models**, primarily designed as **golden reference models** to aid in the verification of RTL designs. These models mimic hardware behavior and are suitable for standalone testing or DPI-C integration with SystemVerilog UVM testbenches.

---

## Projects Overview

- **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU):**  
  A 32-bit C++ implementation of an ALU that supports basic arithmetic, logic, and shift operations. Includes a struct-based result (`result`, `zeroFlag`) and mirrors RTL behavior.  
  → See the [`ALU/`](./ALU) folder for full source and usage.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Language:** C++17  
- **Tested On:** Code::Blocks, GCC (Linux/Windows)  
- **Build Tools:** `g++`, `make` (optional)
